🧠 About Me

👋 Hi, I'm Bahaa Tarek — a Full Stack Developer with a strong engineering background and a passion for building robust, scalable, and production-ready web applications.

I specialize in modern JavaScript-based stacks, focusing on clean code, performance, and maintainability.
My approach combines problem-solving, system thinking, and real-world application design.

I enjoy turning complex ideas into simple, functional products and continuously sharpening my skills by building, breaking, and rebuilding systems the right way.
